# Railway API Integration Setup

## Step 1: Install GraphQL Client Dependencies

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql graphql-request
```

## Step 2: Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Railway GraphQL API Configuration
RAILWAY_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=your-railway-graphql-endpoint
RAILWAY_API_TOKEN=your-railway-api-token
RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

## Step 3: Create Railway Client

We'll create a dedicated client for Railway API operations.

## Step 4: Unified Data Layer

Create a data aggregation layer that combines Crystallize content with Railway product data.

## Step 5: API Routes

Set up Next.js API routes for unified product data access.

Let's start implementing these steps!
